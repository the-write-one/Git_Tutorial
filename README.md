## Pre-requisites

The following software and tools are used:

1. Chrome browser (version 85.0.4183.121).
You can use a browser of your choice to download Git.

## Logging into GitHub

GitHub is a web application and online repository based on the Git version control system.
The GitHub web application allows browsing existing repositories, and performing certain maintanence tasks

2. To sign in, if you already have an account, choose **Sign In** from the top-left menu.

## Creating a Pull Request

Pull request is a mechanism to share your changes with the original project contributors and incorporate your changes in such upstream project.

1. Open the upstream repository in the browser using the link [nobl9/writingtest](https://github.com/nobl9/writingtest).

> ðŸ’¡ The link to the original repository is also located in the tag line **forked from ...** on your forked repository page. (See picture at step 5 in **Find and Fork the Test Repository** above.)
