11. Choose a credential helper and click **Next**.
The credential helpers are external programs from which Git can request both usernames and passwords. These are used so you don't have to type in a username and password every time when accessing a program. Credential helpers can cache your credentials in memory for a short period of time or store credentials indefinitely on disk.

12. Choose to configure extra features and click **Next**. By default, **Enable file system caching** is selected. Enabling system caching provides a significant performance boost.
 **Enable symbolic links** requires permissions. Symbolic links make sure files are in consistent places without moving or copying the original. Multiple copies of the same file can exist in different places, but only one file is referenced.

13. Choose to configure experimental bleeding-edge features and click **Install**. For novice Git users this feature is not recommended. Bleeding-edge features relates to the latest innovative technologies or software builds, which can result in an unstable environment.
